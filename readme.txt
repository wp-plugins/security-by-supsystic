Secure website and defence from all attacks with Security by Supsyctic. Firewall, Login Security, Hide WordPress, Blacklist and more functions

== Description ==

Reliable protection is simple with Security by Supsystic. Plugin allows minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to your files. Security by Supsystic performs constant monitoring of suspicious activity and is capable of promptly responding to alerts. 
Today WordPress is the most common CMS, which means that it is exposed to most attacks and threats.

Convenient setting manager will explain the necessity of each secure feature, allowing selecting the security level. The ultimate security of your website is obtained through a combination of features:

* Login Security
* Scan (folders and files, data-bases for mailware and spyware)
* Firewall
* Black Lists
* Hide WordPress option
* Logs and Statistics

**Login Security**
Integrated protection against unauthorized access. Verifies user’s names and passwords for difficulty. Changes passwords with specified frequency. Two-stage access system. Black-list setting and analysis of access attempts.

**Scan (folders and files, data-bases for mailware and spyware)** 
All data is stored in files and data bases. That’s why after protecting the access “door” and setting Login Security it is important to think about the “back door” as well, including database files access and scanning the files for backdor and mailware.

**Firewall and Black Lists** 
Website requests statistics may serve as a perfect tool to protect it from planned intrusions. Check and monitor the data manually or set automatic filters that will react to suspicious activity by blocking intruders through black lists.

**Hide WordPress option** 
You can easily avoid an attack by disguising the fact that your CMS is Wordpress. We have implemented various hide WordPress options that minimize the risk of identifying your Wordpress website. This option does not affect the functionality and performance of your site.

**Logs and Statistics** 
Statistic analyzes various website requests and helps determine those that represent potential danger to your site. For example, requests that are aimed for system’s vulnerability or have higher frequency.
